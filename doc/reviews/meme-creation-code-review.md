# Meme - Creation code review

## Observations

- When uploading file, nothing happens
- I cannot add any captions
- I cannot submit

## Causes

- The feature is unfinished

## Solution

- We will make sure that the uploaded picture appears, so we can add caption
- We will add inputs in order to change the position of captions
- We will send the meme data to the API to create a new meme, then we will be redirected to the feed and see the new meme
